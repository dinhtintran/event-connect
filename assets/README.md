Place your app logo here as `logo.jpg`.

- Path: `assets/logo.jpg`
- Recommended size: ~512x512 PNG or JPG (will be displayed at 80x80 in the login screen).
- If you have a different filename or path, update `Image.asset(...)` usages in `lib/src/screens/*.dart` and `pubspec.yaml` accordingly.

To add the actual image, copy the image file into this folder in your workspace.
